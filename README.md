## Functionality

*check-processs* and *check-process-restart*  will check processes on a system and alert if specific conditions exist based upon a set of filters that each has implemented.

*check-cmd* will run a specific user designated command and parse the output with a regex or check for a specific status code.  If either of these conditions is not what is expected it will alert.
